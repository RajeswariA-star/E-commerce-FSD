E-Commerce Platform using Full Stack Development
Abstract: This project showcases a basic E-Commerce platform developed using Full Stack Development (FSD) techniques with an innovative touch of Verilog HDL integration. The web platform allows users to browse product categories, mimicking real-time product selection using a Verilog-based logic module. This hybrid approach bridges software development with digital logic design, demonstrating how hardware logic can be incorporated into modern web systems.

echnologies & Concepts Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB

Hardware Logic: Verilog HDL

Simulation Tool: EDA Playground / ModelSim for Verilog simulation

Concepts: Product category selection, logic simulation, full stack integration
